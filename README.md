# Neuroscience for Mental Health

I would like to create this repository to save meaningful and important notes associated with neuroscience-supported mental health advices. This initiative could expand our insight into what we do as researchers in this domain. Thus, it could be very helpful for people around the world. As a researcher in computational neuroscience, I struggle to understand complex problems and find reliable solutions for enhancing our understanding of the brain. I know what failure feels like when studying complicated topics related to the brain and its functions. In my opinion, this is quite normal since biology is a very intriguing domain. Furthermore, the information we collect about the brain is always indirect due to the limitations of neuroimaging technologies. We can only try to create abstract representations of the processes within the brain. However, it is still possible to discover interesting concepts that bridge the gap between biological data and psychological well-being.
