I would like to create this repository to save meaningful and important notes associated with neuroscience supported mental health advices. This initiation could be expand our insight what we do as a researchers in this domain could be very helpful for the people around the world. As a researcher in computational neuroscience, I struggle with understanding complex problems and find reliable solutions for enhancing our understanding for the brain.  I really know what fail is when studying complitaced topics related to brain and its functions. In my opinion, this is quite normal since the biology is very intriguing domain. Furthernore, the information we collect about the brain is always indirect due to the limitations of neuroimaging technologies.
